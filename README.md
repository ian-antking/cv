I am a software engineer with a background in STEM education. I currently work as a Senior at Made Tech, where I help deliver digital transformation for the public sector.

I am passionate about helping to get people into tech. I tutor at [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/), where I teach JavaScript, with React and Express.

In my spare time I make gadgets for my house with raspberry pi, and build/maintain [Queer Family Tea](queerfamilytea.com).

## :building_construction: Projects

### :fireworks: [King Family Photos](https://github.com/ian-antking/king-family-photos)

  The cloud infrastructure which supports a digital photo frame I built for my mother. My personal media server syncs family photos with an `S3 bucket`, which then triggers a `lambda` to copy the image and resize it for display before putting it into another s3 bucket. The photo frame then grabs new photos from this bucket at midnight and displays them. The lambdas were built in `GoLang`, with unit and integration tests. Cloud resources are managed as `Infrastructure as Code` with the `serverless framework`, and automated testing and deployment is performed by `GitHub Actions`.

### :rainbow_flag: [LGBTQ.js](https://ian-antking.github.io/lgbtq.js)

  A simple library for building linear gradient strings for a range of LGBTQ pride flags. Gradients can be customized with opacity and background images. The demo website is built in react with styled-components and tested with react-testing-library, content for the page is loaded from from markdown files with react-markdown. The package is published on NPM, and currently has around 600 weekly downloads.

### :leafy_green: [Stalk Exchange](https://stalk-exchange.herokuapp.com)

  A full stack web app for Animal Crossing players to publish prices form their in-game economy, and make predictions on how prices in their island will change. Hosted on heroku, the back-end is built in express with a mongodb database, and the front-end is built in react with the rebass component library. Frontend tests are written in jest, and react-testing-library.

### :pirate_flag: [The Pirate Gui](ian-antking.github.io/the-pirate-gui)

  [The Pirate Game](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/the-pirate-game-end-of-term-activity-6258063)
  is a popular end of term activity for a lot of teachers and their classes. Originally published on [TES](tes.com),
  it is a game of luck and strategy. On top of this are some practical Maths skills such and handing grid references and keeping
  track of your pirate booty.

  The Pirate Gui is a graphical tool for choosing and displaying random grid references as well as recording the turn order,
  just in case any disagreements happen. The page is built in vanilla javascript, with an object oriented approach to handling
  the map and grid references.

  This App was built in vanilla JavaScript, with an object oriented approach to managing the game board.
