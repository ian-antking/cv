  Software Developer with a background in Science Education. Graduate of and Coding Mentor @ [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/).

## Skills

  Some of the technologies I have worked with, please note this list is not exhaustive:
  `Arduino` `AWS` `Babel` `Bootstrap` `Clojure` `Expo` `Express` `Git` `Java` `Knex.js` `JavaScript` `Jest` `Mocha` `MongoDB` `MySQL` `Node` `Python` `Raspberry Pi` `React` `React Native` `React Testing Library` `Sequelize` `Styled Components` `Webpack`

### Fast Learner :running:

  I learned to code with the Manchester Codes intensive 24 week course. This was studied part-time in addition to working full time as a teacher in a secondary school. While studying, I was introduced to several new technologies, such as React, Express, React Native and Expo. 

  Prior to Manchester Codes, I was able to self learn Python and JavaScript. This was at a level sufficient to teach basic coding in school.

### Problem Solving :mag_right:

  My background in Forensic Science has given me a methodical approach to problem solving. This is coupled with my teaching of computational thinking skills at a secondary school level. From this, I am confident in my ability to break down problems and devise solutions.

### Teaching :man_teacher:

  I am passionate about teaching and am a coding tutor at Manchester Codes. I have also helped other people to learn to code at events such as [Full Stack of Pancakes](https://www.fullstackofpancakes.com/) and [Code Bar](https://codebar.io/).

## Projects

  ### [The Pirate Gui](ian-antking.github.io/the-pirate-gui)

  [The Pirate Game](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/the-pirate-game-end-of-term-activity-6258063) 
  is a popular end of term activity for a lot of teachers and their classes. Originally published on [TES](tes.com), 
  it is a game of luck and strategy. On top of this are some practical Maths skills such and handing grid references and keeping 
  track of your pirate gold.

  The Pirate Gui is a graphical tool for choosing and displaying random grid references as well as recording the turn order, 
  just in case any disagreements happen. The page is built in vanilla javascript, with an object oriented approach to handling 
  the map and grid references.

  This App was built in pure JavaScript, with an object oriented approach to managing the game board.

  ### [CMail](ian-antking.github.io/cmail-js)

  A simulated email client for teaching Functional Skills English. Built in react as a single page application. Learners can reply to one of the messages in the inbox, or start from scratch with a new email. Clicking the send button formats the text for printing or saving as a pdf. Clicking back from an email in progress stores it for later.

  This application was built in React, with Material UI components.

  ### [GeoGraffiti](https://github.com/JonnyEdge/geograffiti)

  My final project (with [Johnny Edge](https://github.com/JonnyEdge)) for the Manchester Codes course. 
  Intended as an Instagram-type application, users can upload pictures of graffiti which are then displayed on a map at the location 
  the picture was taken (using the location data embedded in the image). Users can also explore the map to find other pictures of 
  graffiti and street art. 

  This app was built in Expo, with React Native. The [companion api](https://github.com/ian-antking/geo-graffiti-api)
    was build in express and deployed to Heroku. Images were stored on AWS S3.
