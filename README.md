I am a software engineer with a background in STEM education. I currently work as a Senior at Made Tech, where I help deliver digital transformation for the public sector.

I am passionate about helping to get people into tech. I tutor [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/), where I teach JavaScript, with React and Express.

In my spare time I make gadgets for my house with raspberry pi, and build/maintain [Queer Family Tea](queerfamilytea.com).

## :building_construction: Projects

### :rainbow_flag: [LGBTQ.js](https://ian-antking.github.io/lgbtq.js)

  A simple library for building linear gradient strings for a range of LGBTQ pride flags. Gradients can be customized with opacity and background images. The demo website is built in react with styled-components and tested with react-testing-library, content for the page is loaded from from markdown files with react-markdown.

  A full stack web app for Animal Crossing players to publish prices form their in-game economy, and make predictions on how prices in their island will change. Hosted on heroku, the back-end is built in express with a mongodb database, and the front-end is built in react with rebass component library. Frontend tests are written in jest, and react-testing-library for the frontend app.

### :tea: [Queer Family Tea](https://queerfamilytea.com)

  A reactive web page for a lgbtq+ social group. Current Version is built with react-components-bulma, and serves content from Contentful.

### :pirate_flag: [The Pirate Gui](ian-antking.github.io/the-pirate-gui)

  [The Pirate Game](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/the-pirate-game-end-of-term-activity-6258063)
  is a popular end of term activity for a lot of teachers and their classes. Originally published on [TES](tes.com),
  it is a game of luck and strategy. On top of this are some practical Maths skills such and handing grid references and keeping
  track of your pirate booty.

  The Pirate Gui is a graphical tool for choosing and displaying random grid references as well as recording the turn order,
  just in case any disagreements happen. The page is built in vanilla javascript, with an object oriented approach to handling
  the map and grid references.

  This App was built in vanilla JavaScript, with an object oriented approach to managing the game board.

### :email: [CMail](ian-antking.github.io/cmail-js)

  A simulated email client for teaching Functional Skills English. Built in react as a single page application. Learners can reply to one of the messages in the inbox, or start from scratch with a new email. Clicking the send button formats the text for printing or saving as a pdf. Clicking back from an email in progress stores it for later.

### :world_map: [GeoGraffiti](https://github.com/JonnyEdge/geograffiti)

  My final project (with [Johnny Edge](https://github.com/JonnyEdge)) for the Manchester Codes course.
  Intended as an Instagram-type application, users can upload pictures of graffiti which are then displayed on a map at the location
  the picture was taken (using the location data embedded in the image). Users can also explore the map to find other pictures of
  graffiti and street art.

  This app was built in Expo, with React Native. The [companion api](https://github.com/ian-antking/geo-graffiti-api)
    was build in express and deployed to Heroku. Images were stored on AWS S3.
