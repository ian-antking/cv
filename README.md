## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer with a strong interest in public sector digital transformation. At **Made Tech**, I lead teams delivering scalable, secure, and accessible services. I focus on maintainable architecture, pragmatic delivery, and continuous improvement.

I'm technology agnostic, with a preference for **strongly typed languages** and modern cloud-native infrastructure. I enjoy mentoring early-career developers and helping teams adopt better engineering practices through pairing, code review, and shared ownership.
