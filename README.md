### Fast Learner :running:

  I learned to code with the Manchester Codes intensive 24 week course. This was studied part-time in addition to working full time as a teacher in a secondary school. While studying, I was introduced to several new technologies, such as React, Express, Reac Native and Expo. 

  Prior to Manchester Codes, I was able to self learn Python and JavaScript. This was at a level sufficient to teach basic coding in school.

### Problem Solving :mag_right:

  My background in Forensic Science has given me a methodical approach to problem solving. This is coupled with my teaching of computational thinking skills at a secondary school level. From this, I am confident in my ability to break down problems and devise solutions.

### Teaching :man_teacher:

  I am passionate about teaching and am a coding mentor at Manchester Codes. I have also help other people to learn to code at events such as [Full Stack of Pancakes](https://www.fullstackofpancakes.com/).
